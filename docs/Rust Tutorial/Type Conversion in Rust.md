# Type Conversion in Rust

Handling different data types is a common task in programming, and Rust makes it seamless with its robust type conversion capabilities. In this article, we'll explore how to convert between various data types in Rust effortlessly.

## Numeric Conversions

Rust allows you to convert between numeric types using the `as` keyword. Consider the following example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let integer: i32 = 42;
    let floating_point: f64 = integer as f64;

    println!("Converted value: {}", floating_point);
}
```

In this example, we convert an integer to a floating-point number using the `as` keyword.

## String Conversion

Converting between strings and other types is a common operation. Rust provides methods like `to_string` and `parse` to facilitate string conversion. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number_str = "42";
    let number: i32 = number_str.parse().unwrap();

    println!("Parsed number: {}", number);
}
```

In this example, we parse a string into an integer using the `parse` method.

Understanding type conversion is crucial for handling diverse data in Rust effectively. As your Rust journey continues, stay tuned for more advanced topics and in-depth explorations.
