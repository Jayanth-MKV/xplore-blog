Welcome to the world of Rust! In this article, we'll kick off your Rust adventure with the timeless tradition of writing a "Hello, World!" program. Rust's syntax and structure may feel new, but fear not â€“ we'll guide you through every step.

To get started, let's create a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Open your favorite text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) and follow along.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

Now, let's break down what's happening here:

- `fn main()`: This line declares the main function, which is the entry point for every Rust program.
- `println!("Hello, World!");`: This line prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

Once you've typed the code, save the file with a `.rs` extension, such as `hello_world.rs`. Now, let's run our program. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and enter the following command:

```bash
rustc hello_world.rs
./hello_world
```

Congratulations! You've just run your first Rust program. Stay tuned as we explore more exciting aspects of Rust in the upcoming articles.
